# hotSpice

This is a collection of gschem schematics made to work with ngspice.

All started with some examples to make my son interested into electronics.
It snowballed quickly into a sort of educational tool, and besides it's fun, so I am putting it there for other people to enjoy.

You will need gschem, ngspice and gnuplot.

1) It's Linux only
2) cd into the project directory
3) launch RUNME.sh
